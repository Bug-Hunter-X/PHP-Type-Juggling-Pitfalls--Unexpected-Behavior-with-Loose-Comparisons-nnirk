This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue with PHP's type juggling and how it can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values.
```php
$a = 0;
$b = '0';

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Values are equal (loose comparison)\n";
}

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Values are identical (strict comparison)\n";
}
```
In this example, a loose comparison (`==`) will return `true` because PHP implicitly converts the string '0' to an integer 0 before comparing. However, a strict comparison (`===`) will return `false` because the types are different (integer vs. string). This can cause unexpected issues if you're not aware of this behavior.
