The solution lies in consistently using strict comparisons (`===` and `!==`) instead of loose comparisons (`==` and `!=`).  Strict comparisons check for both value and type equality, eliminating the ambiguity introduced by type juggling.
```php
$a = 0;
$b = '0';

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Values are identical (strict comparison)\n";
} else {
  echo "Values are NOT identical (strict comparison)\n";
}
```
By employing strict comparisons, we ensure that the code behaves predictably and avoids the pitfalls associated with PHP's implicit type conversions.
