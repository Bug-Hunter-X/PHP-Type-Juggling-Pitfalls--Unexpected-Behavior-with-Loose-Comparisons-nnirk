This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in PHP programming: unexpected behavior arising from PHP's type juggling, particularly during loose comparisons. The `bug.php` file illustrates the issue, while `bugSolution.php` shows how to mitigate it using strict comparisons.  The core problem stems from the fact that PHP automatically converts values between different types when using loose comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, etc.). This can lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully. The solution presented emphasizes the importance of strict comparisons (`===`, `!==`) to ensure that both value and type are checked before making decisions.
